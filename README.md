# 💫 About Me:
I am currently pursuing a PhD at the DAVID laboratory [DAVID laboratory](https://www.david.uvsq.fr/) in collaboration with the University of Versailles Saint Quentin and Paris Saclay. My research focuses on “Machine learning and meta-optimization: a hybrid approach for operational research on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).” This GitHub repository will serve as a space to share the various developments and progress of my thesis work.
